Function 
The service module contains the main spacecraft 
propulsion system and supplies most of the spacecraft's consumables (oxygen, water, propellant, 
hydrogen). It is not manned. The service module 
remains attached to the command module until 
just before entry, when it is jettisoned and is 
destroyed during entry.

The service module is a cylindrical structure which 
serves as a storehouse of critical subsystems and 
supplies for almost the entire lunar mission. It is 
attached to the command module from launch until 
just before earth atmosphere entry. 
The service module contains the spacecraft's main 
propulsion engine, which is used to brake the spacecraft and put it into orbit around the moon and to 
send it on the homeward journey from the moon. 
The engine also is used to correct the spacecraft's 
course on both the trips to and from the moon. 
Besides the service propulsion engine and its propellant and helium tanks, the service module contains a major portion of the electrical power, 
environmental control, and reaction control subsystems, and a small portion of the communications subsystem. 
It is strictly a servicing unit of the spacecraft, but 
it is more than twice as long and more than four 
times as heavy as the manned command module. 
About 75 percent of the service module's weight 
is in propellant for the service propulsion engine. 
STRUCTURE 
The service module is a relatively simple structure 
consisting of a center section or tunnel surrounded 
by six pie-shaped sectors. 
The basic structural components are forward and 
aft (upper and lower) bulkheads, six radial beams, 
four sector honeycomb panels, four reaction control system honeycomb panels, an aft heat shield, 
and a fairing. 
The radial beams are made of solid aluminum 
alloy which has been machined and chem-milled 
(metal removed by chemical action) to thicknesses 
varying between 2 inches and 0.018 inch, thus making a lightweight, efficient structure. 
The forward and aft bulkheads cover the top and 
bottom of the module. Radial beam trusses extending above the forward bulkhead support and 
secure the command module. Three of these beams 
have compression pads and the other three have 
shear-compression pads and tension ties. Explosive 
charges in the center sections of these tension ties 
are used to separate the two modules. 
An aft heat shield surrounds the service propulsion

engine to protect the service module from the 
engine's heat during thrusting. The gap between the 
command module and the forward bulkhead of the 
service module is closed off with a fairing which is 
'Y:!-inch thick and 22 inches high. The fairing is composed of 16 pieces; eight electrical power subsystem 
radiators alternated with eight aluminum honeycomb panels. 
The center section is circular and is 44 inches in 
diameter. 
Maintenance doors around the exterior of the 
module provide access to equipment within each 
sector. These doors are designed for installation and 
checkout operations and are not used during space 
operations .. 
The sector and reaction control system panels are 
1-inch thick and are made of aluminum honeycomb 
core between two aluminum face sheets. The sector 
panels are bolted to the radial beams. Radiators used 
to dissipate heat from the environmental control 
subsystem are bonded to the sector panels on opposite sides of the module. These radiators are each 
about 30 square feet in area.

SECTORS 
The service module's six sectors are of three sizes, 
with two sectors each of the same size. The 360 
degrees around the center section is divided among 
two 50-degree (Sectors 1 and 4), two 60-degree 
(Sectors 3 and 6), and two 70-degree (Sectors 2 
and 5) compartments. 
SECTOR 1 
It is not currently planned to install any equipment 
in this sector. The space is thus available if any 
additional equipment needs to be added to the 
spacecraft for the lunar mission or if equipment is 
added for scientific experiments. Ballast may be 
stowed in the sector to maintain the service 
module's center of gravity if no equipment is added. 
56 
SECTOR 2 
One of the two 70-degree sectors, contains part of 
a space radiator and a reaction control subsystem 
engine quad on its exterior panel, and the oxidizer 
sump tank, its plumbing, and the reaction control 
engine tanks and plumbing within the sector. 
The oxidizer sump tank is the larger of the two 
tanks that hold the oxidizer (nitrogen tetroxide) 
for the service propulsion engine. A cylindrical tank 
made of titanium, it is 153.8 inches high (about 
12 feet 9-% inches) and has a diameter of 51 
inches (4 feet 3 inches). It holds 13,923 pounds of 
oxidizer. It is the tank from which oxidizer is fed to 
the engine. Feed lines connect the sump tank to the 
service propulsion engine and to the oxidizer storage 
tank. 
SECTOR 3 
Sector 3 is one of the 60-degree sectors, and contains the rest of the space radiator and a reaction 
control engine quad on its exterior panel, and the 
oxidizer storage tank and its plumbing within the 
sector. 
The oxidizer storage tank is similar to the sump 
tank but not quite as large. It is 154.47 inches high 
(about 12 feet 10-% inches) and has a diameter of 
45 inches. It holds 1 1,284 pounds of oxidizer. 
Oxidizer is fed from it to the oxidizer sump tank 
in Sector 2. 
SECTO R 4 
Sector 4 is one of the 50-degree sectors and contains most of the electrical power subsystem equipment in the service module, including three fuel 
cell powerplants, two cryogenic oxygen and two 
cryogenic hydrogen tanks, and a power control 
relay box. A helium servicing panel also is located 
in this sector. 
The three fuel cell powerplants are mounted on 
a shelf in the upper third of the sector. Each powerplant is 44 inches high, 22 inches in diameter, and 
weighs about 245 pounds. They supply most of the 
electrical power for the spacecraft as well as some 
of the drinking water. 
The cryogenic (ultra low temperature) tanks supply 
oxygen to the environmental control subsystem and 
oxygen and hydrogen to the fuel cell powerplants. 
The tanks are spheres, with the oxygen tanks 
mounted side by side in the center of the sector and 
the hydrogen tanks mounted below them one on 
top of the other. 
The oxygen tanks are made of lnconel (a nickelsteel alloy) and are a little over 26 inches in diameter. Each holds 326 pounds of oxygen in a semiliquid, semi-gas state. Operating temperature of the 
tanks ranges from 300 degrees below zero to 80 
above. Oxygen must be maintained at 297 degrees 
below zero to remain liquid. 
The hydrogen tanks are made of titanium and are 
about 31-% inches in diameter. Each holds a little 
over 29 pounds of hydrogen. (Hydrogen is much 
lighter than oxygen, so that in vessels of the same 
volume the weight of the oxygen would be far 
greater.) The hydrogen also is in a semi-gas, semiSECTOR 3 (Gin

liquid stage, and its operating temperature ranges 
from 425 degrees below zero to 80 above. To remain liquid, hydrogen must be maintained at 423 
degrees below zero. 
The power control relay box operates in conjunction with the fuel cell powerplants to control 
the generation and distribution of electrical power. 
SECTOR 5 
This is the other 70-degree sector; it contains 
part of an environmental control radiator and a 
reaction control engine quad on the exterior panel, 
and the fuel sump tank within the sector. 
The fuel sump tank occupies almost all of the 
space with the sector. It is a cylindrical titanium 
tank the same· size as the oxidizer sump tank: 
153.8 inches high (12 feet 9-% inches) and 51 inches 
in diameter. It holds 8,708 pounds of propellant 
(a 50-50 mixture of hydrazine and unsymmetrical 
dimethylhydrazine) for the service propulsion 
engine. It is the tank from which the fuel is fed to 
the engine; feed lines also connect it to the fuel 
storage tank. 
SECTO R 6 
The other 60-degree sector contains the rest 
of the space radiator and a reaction control engine

The fuel storage tank is the same size as the oxidizer storage tank: 154.47 inches high (about 
12 feet 1 0-% inches) and 45 inches in diameter. 
It holds 7,058 pounds of fuel. Fuel is fed from it 
to the fuel sump tank in Sector 5. 
The sump tanks and the storage tanks for fuel and 
oxidizer are the same size; the difference in weight 
each contains is that the oxidizer is more than 50-
percent heavier than the fuel. 
CENTER SECTION 
The center section or tunnel contains two helium 
tanks and the service propulsion engine. 
The helium tanks are spherical vessels about 40 
inches in diameter located one on top of the other 
in the upper half of the center section. Each contains 19.6 cubic feet of helium gas under a pressure 
of 3600 psi. This gas is used to pressurize the oxi58 
dizer and fuel tanks of the service propulsion subsystem. The pressure forces the propellant from one 
tank to another and through the feed lines to the 
engine. 
The service propulsion engine is located in the 
lower half of the center section, with its nozzle 
extension skirt protruding more than 9 feet below 
the aft bulkhead of the module. The length of the 
engine including the skirt is 152.82 inches (about 
12 feet 8 inches) and its weight is 650 pounds. This 
engine is used as a retrorocket to brake the spacecraft and put it into orbit around the moon, to 
supply the thrust for the return to earth from the 
moon, and for course corrections on the trips to 
and from the moon. 
EXTERIOR 
Located on the exterior of the service module 
are space radiators for both the environmental 
control and electrical power subsystems, reaction 
control subsystem engines, three antennas, umbilical connections, and several lights. 
The environmental control subsystem space radiators are the larger ones and are located on the 
lower half of the service module on opposite sides. 
One is part of the panel covers for Sectors 2 and 3 
and the other is part of the panel covers for 
Sectors 5 and 6. The radiators, each about 30 square 
feet, consist of five parallel primary tubes and four 
secondary tubes mounted horizontally and one 
series tube mounted vertically. The water-glycol 
coolant flows through these tubes to radiate to the 
cold of space the heat it has absorbed from the 
command module cabin and from operating electronic equipment. 
The electrical power subsystem space radiators 
are located on the fairing at the top of the service 
module. Each of the eight radiator panels (which 
are alternated with eight aluminum honeycomb 
panels) contains three tubes which are used to 
radiate to space excess heat produced by the fuel 
cell powerplants. A separate radiation loop is used 
for each powerplant; that is, one of the tubes on 
each panel is connected to a specific powerplant. 
The reaction control subsystem engines are located 
in four clusters of 90 degrees apart around the 
upper portion of service module. The clusters or 
quads are arranged in such a manner that the engines 
are on the outside of the panels and all the other 
P-70 
Technician prepares service propulsion engine for installation in service module 
components are on the inside. The engines are 
mounted with two pointed up and down and two 
pointed to the sides in opposite directions. Components of the quad panels on the inside of the 
sectors include two oxidizer and two fuel tanks, a 
helium tank, and associated valves, regulators, and 
plumbing. Each quad package is eight feet long and 
nearly three feet wide. 
The four antennas on the outside of the service 
module are the S-band high-gain antenna, mounted 
on the aft bulkhead; two VHF omni-directional 
antennas, mounted on opposite sides of the module 
near the top; and the rendezvous radar transponder 
antenna, mounted in the SM fairing. The S-band 
high-gain antenna, used for deep space communications, is composed of four 31-inch diameter 
reflectors surrounding an 11-inch square reflector. 
At launch it is folded down parallel to the service 
propulsion engine nozzle so that it fits within the 
spacecraft- LM adapter. After the CSM separates 
from the adapter the antenna is deployed at a 
right angle to the service module. The omnidirectional antennas, called scimitars because of 
their shape, are made of stainless steel and are 
approximately 13-% inches long and only a hundredth of an inch thick. 
59 
P-71 CM-SM umbilical assembly 
The umbilicals consist of the main plumbing and 
wiring connections between the command module 
and service module, which are enclosed in a fairing 
(aluminum covering), and a "flyaway" umbilical 
which is connected to the launch tower. The latter 
s�pplies oxygen and nitrogen for cabin pressurization
.' water-glycol, electrical power from ground 
equ1pment, and purge gas. 
Seven lights are mounted in the aluminum panels 
of the fairing. Four (one red, one green, and two 
amber) are used to aid the astronauts in docking, 
one is a floodlight which can be turned on to give 
astronauts visibility during extravehicular activities 
one is a flashing beacon used to aid in rendezvous' 
and one is a spotlight used in rendezvous from 500 
feet to docking with the lunar module. 
SM-CM SEPARATION 
Separation of the SM from the CM occurs shortly 
before entry. The sequence of events during separation is controlled automatically by two redundant 
service module jettison controllers, located on the 
forward bulkhead of the SM. 
A number of events must occur in rapid sequence 
or at the same time for proper separation. These 
include physical separation of all the connections 
between the modules, transfer of electrical control, and firing of the service module's reaction 
control engines to increase the distance between 
the modules. 
Before separation, the crewmen in the CM transfer 
60 
electrical control to the CM reaction control subsystem (the SM reaction control subsystem is used 
for attitude maneuvers throughout the mission up 
to entry) so that they can pressurize it and check it 
out for the entry maneuvers. 
Electrical control is then transferred back to the 
SM subsystem. Separation is started manually, by 
activation of either of two redundant switches on 
the main display console. These switches send signals to the SM jettison controllers. The controllers 
first send a signal to fire ordnance devices which 
activat� the CM-SM electrical circuit interrupters; 
these mterrupters deadface (cut off all power to) 
the electrical wires in the CM-SM umbilical. 
A tenth of a second after the wires are deadfaced 
the controllers send signals which fire ordnanc� 
devices to sever the physical connections between 
the modules. These connections are three tension 
tie� and the umbilical. The tension ties are straps 
wh1ch hold the CM on three of the compression 
pads on the SM. Linear-shaped charges in each 
tension-tie assembly sever the tension ties to separate 
the modules. At the same time, explosive charges 
drive guillotines through the wiring and tubing in the 
umbilical. 
Simultaneously with the firing of the ordnance 
devices, the controllers send signals which fire the 
SM reaction control engines. Roll engines are fired 
for 5 seconds to alter the SM's course from that of 
the CM, and the translation (thrust) engines are 
fired continuously until the propellant is depleted 
or fuel cell power is expended. These maneuvers 
carry the SM well away from the entry path of 
the CM. 
The service module will enter the earth's atmosphere after separation and burn up.
