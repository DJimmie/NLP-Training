identify all the categories, types, things and objects that are important for that field, and
we then understand more and more how they relate to each other and what information
is available to describe them even more accurately. We call this the ‘conceptual model,’
and in a semantic knowledge graph this is represented by a schema or ontology.
Since we express knowledge not only schematically, but also, and above all, through human language, very individually and in different languages, we must also provide a ‘linguistic model’ for our knowledge graph. The linguistic model serves to label and further
describe and contextualize the individual elements of the conceptual model and their
individual instances. In a semantic knowledge graph this is made possible by controlled
vocabularies such as taxonomies. The linguistic model is derived from the analysis of
existing information from a domain and its instance data as well as from the experience
gained in this field.
Part 1, the "information analysis" can be largely automated by machine learning, while
part 2, the "deriving knowledge from experience" can be performed by domain experts.
Ideally, these two elements are combined to build the conceptual and linguistic model
based on information and experience in a given domain.
A scope for the domain to be represented by the conceptual model can be calculated
by means of a reference text corpus or by means of so-called “key questions,” which are
specified by potential business users.
