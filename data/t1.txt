AKA: 11F615A15;7K-TG. Status: Operational 1978. First Launch: 1978-01-20. Last Launch: 1990-05-05. Number: 43 . Thrust: 4.09 kN (919 lbf). Gross mass: 7,020 kg (15,470 lb). Unfuelled mass: 6,520 kg (14,370 lb). Specific impulse: 282 s. Height: 7.48 m (24.54 ft).

The re-entry module was deleted and replaced with a section containing propellant tanks and pumping systems for space station refueling. The orbital module was used to transport dry cargo and water to the station.

Some Progress were launched with a Soyuz Launch Escape System tower. Officially, this was to preserve proven Soyuz aerodynamics. In fact, the tower for these launches included ejection seats planned for use with the Buran spaceplane.
