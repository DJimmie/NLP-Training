APU consumables pre-mission planning includes prediction, analysis, and post-flight performance evaluations for determining consumables requirements. APU 
hydrazine and injector cooling water-loading quantities are loaded per OMRSD requirements, which allow for loading uncertainty. Launch Commit Criteria monitor 
for hydrazine leakage, ensure sufficient GN2 for gearbox repressurization and verify adequate hydraulic fluid quantity for flight. Minimum pre-deorbit APU fuel 
quantity requirements are defined in the Flight Rules.  Mission Control Center monitors consumables usage during the mission. Mission planning includes 
derivation of APU fuel reserves. Orbiter Fluid Budget allows for loading uncertainty and shows adequate reserves after worst-case consumption during Abort Once 
Around (AOA) landing. APU gas generator injector tube cooling water-loading quantity is provided for contingency operations only when a hot APU restart is 
required (sufficient time is not available for normal APU cool down time of about 180 minutes). Cooling water quantity provided is sufficient for six hot restarts
